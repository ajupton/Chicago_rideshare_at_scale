Forecasting rideshare demand in Chicago with AWS EMR and Pyspark

As companies, institutions, and enterprises increasingly recognize the value of data-driven solutions, the need for big data analytics expertise will only continue to grow. Insight Data Science, a premier postdoctoral fellowship program that transitions academics into data roles in industry, is committed to removing barriers around applying big data technologies and empowering fellows and non-fellows alike with the tools they need to succeed in a distributed computing environment. This repo contains notebooks and tutorials designed to not only predict rideshare demand in the city of Chicago, but how to make such predictions using a distributed computing environment on AWS EC2 and EMR instances.
